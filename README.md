# Introduction

Escoba is a popular Spanish card game. The name "Escoba" translates to "broom" in Spanish, which reflects the game's objective of "sweeping" all the cards from the table1. It is typically played with a Spanish-suited deck of 40 cards and can accommodate 2 to 4 players.

Escoba's fun is based in its blend of strategy and luck. Players must carefully choose which cards to play and capture, aiming to accumulate points by making combinations that add up to 15. The game is fast-paced and engaging, often leading to exciting and competitive rounds. Plus, its simple rules make it accessible to players of all ages.
